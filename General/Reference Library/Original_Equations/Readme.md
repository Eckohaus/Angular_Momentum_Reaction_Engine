###### The root matrice // Defined as '1.5578' Equals a combination equation based upon 'Plancks Length' and 'Plancks Constant'.

###### Nucleotide Ratio's // Are defined as an inference point within hydrogen based equations. When creating lambda based equations. The representaion becomes the following :

---
 
###### (1.14) = (Nucleotide Ratio)
###### (1.1) = ( E=mc2, defined within a wave structure)
###### (1.14^1.1) = (Nucleotide ratio to the power E=mc2)
