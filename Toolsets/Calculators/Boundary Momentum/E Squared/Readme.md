[Data Cartography : Video Guide](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBx_-O2xTMh73vurWagwrFdKhBCktEPLK)

##### The aim  was to define the underlying units of energy which underpin interest rates. A continuation study from the FTSE Historical A,B,C guide. Which looked more closely at what defines inflation/deflation. When in consideration of {E/e SQ} Within both eigenvalue sets and statistical volatility curves.

#### Ascertaining the root metric of Binary state {1}

##### We first determine the nature of the orbital plane, withinin the [Zeta Function ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_zeta_function)

#### Spin Polarities

##### Wave Function + Angle of Momentum {Nucleotide Constant}

##### 1.1^-.33 = 0.96903712092

##### 1.1^.33 = 1.03195221154

##### Wave Function + Angle of Momentum {Light Constant}

##### 1.1^.77 = 0.92923943574

##### 1.1^.77 = 1.07614890364

##### Understanding the Persistence plane of binary state {1} within a [tangential vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_functions) When co-assigned with Binary state {0} [Refractive Index. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_index)
